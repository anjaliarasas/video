    i really struggled with this project and am still struggling with it TT. i am trying to get the shapes to appear on top/within the video but it's not appearing on top of the video, only outside sad face. i know it must have something to do with the canvas and how i got rid of it, but i couldn't find how to put the video in p5 without getting rid of the canvas... also i wanted multiple pink ellipse to appear around the video like pulsating but only one is appearing even though i put multiple in the code im soso saddd. i'm gonna try to fix it tomorrow also hopefully! see you in class smiley face.
